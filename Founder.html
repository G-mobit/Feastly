    A Piece of My Life ‚Äì Dev Verma

    <div class="soft-box">
      <p>
        Hey üëã, I‚Äôm <span class="highlight">Dev Verma</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not a company. Not a brand. Just a boy from <strong>Nalanda, Bihar</strong>, who grew up with a quiet dream... to create something of his own.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page isn't formal. It's not business. It's just my voice, written here for you ‚Äî real and raw.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Where it all began</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in <strong>Nalanda</strong> in 2013. A land full of history, calm roads, and the soft sound of temple bells in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      While kids were chasing cricket balls, I was chasing something else ‚Äî the joy of building things, the feeling of typing something... and seeing it *come alive on screen*.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
      "Feastly didn‚Äôt start as a website. It started as a feeling."
    </div>

    <p>
      A feeling to bring people together with food. To let someone, somewhere, find comfort in a recipe. To let them feel at home ‚Äî no matter where they are.
    </p>

    <h2>Feastly is my voice</h2>
    <p>
      I built it myself ‚Äî every word, every color, every corner. From scratch. Not because I had to, but because it meant something.
    </p>
    <p>
      It‚Äôs not perfect. But it‚Äôs mine. And that makes it beautiful.
    </p>

    <h2>I'm not a team. I‚Äôm just me.</h2>
    <p>
      I didn‚Äôt hire anyone. No designers. No writers. No investors. Just one kid with a laptop, a head full of dreams, and a heart full of India.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Idea & Vision:</strong> Me</li>
      <li><strong>Design & Code:</strong> Me</li>
      <li><strong>Words & Emotions:</strong> Me</li>
      <li><strong>Love & Soul:</strong> Me</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>To You, The Reader</h2>
    <p>
      If you're here, reading this ‚Äî thank you. You‚Äôre not just visiting a website. You‚Äôve stepped into someone‚Äôs world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you feel the warmth. The honesty. The "apna-pan".
    </p>

    <!-- New serious warning section -->
    <div class="real-talk">
      <p><strong>Real Talk:</strong> Beware of restaurants and food outlets that serve fake or low-quality food ‚Äî like paneer made from poor ingredients, reused oil for frying again and again, and dirty kitchens. These harmful practices are not only disrespectful but dangerous for your health.</p>
      <p>Eating from such places repeatedly can lead to serious health issues including indigestion, food poisoning, long-term liver and kidney damage, and increased risk of chronic diseases. Please choose wisely, demand honesty, and support cleanliness and quality. Your body deserves better than shortcuts and fakes.</p>
